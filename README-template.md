## My process

I began by considering whether to start with the mobile or desktop design. Ultimately, I opted to begin with the desktop design as it felt more comfortable to me. Once I had the design in place, I began applying CSS styles, and once those were complete, I implemented the JavaScript.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanila Javscript

### What I learned

Typically, I don't use vanilla JavaScript to create projects. I have used React.js and Next.js for most of my projects, but with this particular project, I had the opportunity to work more extensively with vanilla JavaScript. Through the process, I learned a lot and gained a newfound appreciation for the benefits that libraries provide. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed every step of the process and found it to be a lot of fun.
